## Project structure

The project uses a single app to combine a variety of functionalities. Each function is loaded as a fragment for you to play with.

| Function                                                                        | Location                                                                                                                                 |

### Steps to run

1. 
2. 
3.

   > See [Set up Authentication](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/token) to learn how to get an App ID and access token. You can get a temporary access token to quickly try out this sample project.
   >
   > The Channel name you used to generate the token must be the same as the channel name you use to join a channel.

   > To ensure communication security, Agora uses access tokens (dynamic keys) to authenticate users joining a channel.
   >
   > Temporary access tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating access tokens. See [Generate a Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/token_server) for details.

You are all set! Feel free to play with this sample project and explore features of the Agora RTC SDK.
